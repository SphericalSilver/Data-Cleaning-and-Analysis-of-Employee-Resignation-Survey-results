    "# Analysis of Employee Exit Survey Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I'm a Data Analyst tasked with cleaning and analyzing Employee Exit Survey responses from employees of [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland) (DETE), and the [Technical and Further Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE_Queensland) (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The DETE exit survey data can be [found here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey), and the TAFE exist survey data can be [found here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're looking to gain answers to the following questions:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're recquired to combine the results for both surveys to answer the above questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers - something that will introduce some complications into our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by reading the datasets into pandas, and then beginning an initial round of exploration."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we can fairly conclusively say that employees who've been at an institute longer are by far more likely to resign citing dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend is also somewhat reflected by age group, with older employees being more likely to report dissatisfaction. It should be noted that employees in the 26-35 age groups don't fit this trend, as they have some of the highest dissatisfaction rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it might also ostensibly appear like employees of the DETE institute might be more likely to resign reporting dissatisfaction, that trend seems much better explained by the fact that there were simply more survey answers that corresponded to a 'dissatisfied' outcome in the results of the DETE survey. This unequalness in the way the survey results of both institutes were handled is one limitation that was observed in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable limitation is that dissatisfaction results were merely handled as a binary 'dissatisfied' or 'not dissatisfied', as opposed to, for instance, having employees rate their dissatisfaction on a scale of 1-10. The latter might have reflected employee sentiment more accurately, as it represents a spectrum of satisfaction that tends to correspond better to a person's actual feelings."
